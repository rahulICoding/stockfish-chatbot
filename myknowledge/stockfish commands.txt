UCI & Commands
The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is a standard text-based protocol used to communicate with a chess engine and is the recommended way to do so for typical graphical user interfaces (GUI) or chess tools. Stockfish implements the majority of its options.
Developers can see the default values for the UCI options available in Stockfish by typing ./stockfish uci in a terminal, but most users should typically use a chess GUI to interact with Stockfish.

Standard commands
quit
Quit the program as soon as possible.
uci
Tell the engine to use the UCI (universal chess interface).
This will be sent once, by a GUI, as a first command after the program boots to tell the engine to switch to UCI mode.
After receiving the uci command the engine will identify itself with the id command and send the option commands to tell the GUI which engine settings the engine supports.
After that, the engine will send uciok to acknowledge the UCI mode.
If no uciok is sent within a certain time period, the engine task will be killed by the GUI.
ExampleNote that a different Stockfish version than the one used below may have a different output, with different values and other available options. Please run this command yourself to know what values are available in your specific version.

uciok
setoption
Usage: setoption name <id> [value <x>]
This is sent to the engine when the user wants to change the internal parameters of the engine. For the button type no value is needed.
One string will be sent for each parameter and this will only be sent when the engine is waiting.
Examples:
> setoption name Threads value 6
> setoption name SyzygyPath value C:\Chess\tb\tb345;C:\Chess\tb\wdl6;C:\Chess\tb\wdl7
> setoption name UCI_ShowWDL value true
> setoption name Clear Hash
List of options:
* Threads
type spin default 1 min 1 max 1024
The number of CPU threads used for searching a position. For best performance, set this equal to the number of CPU cores available.
* Hash
type spin default 16 min 1 max 33554432
The size of the hash table in MB. It is recommended to set Hash after setting Threads.
* MultiPV
type spin default 1 min 1 max 500
Output the N best lines (principal variations, PVs) when searching. Leave at 1 for the best performance.
* NumaPolicy
type string default auto
Binds threads to a specific NUMA node to enhance performance on multi-CPU or multi-NUMA domain systems. Options:
   * none - assumes a single NUMA node, no thread binding
   * system - uses NUMA information available from the system and binds the threads accordingly
   * auto - default; automatically selects system or none based on the system
   * hardware - uses NUMA information from the underlying hardware and binds the threads accordingly, overrides any previous affinities.
Should be used if Stockfish doesn't utilize all threads, e.g. Windows 10 or certain GUI's like ChessBase.
   * [[custom]] - precisely specify the available CPUs per numa domain. ':' separates numa nodes; ',' separates cpu indices; supports "first-last" range syntax for cpu indices, for example 0-15,32-47:16-31,48-63
      * Clear Hash
type button
Clear the hash table.
      * Ponder
type check default false
Let Stockfish ponder its next move while the opponent is thinking.
      * EvalFile
type string default nn-[SHA256 first 12 digits].nnue
The name of the file of the NNUE evaluation parameters. Depending on the GUI the filename might have to include the full path to the folder/directory that contains the file. Other locations, such as the directory that contains the binary and the working directory, are also searched.
      * EvalFileSmall
type string default nn-[SHA256 first 12 digits].nnue
Same as EvalFile.
      * UCI_Chess960
type check default false
An option handled by your GUI. If true, Stockfish will play Chess960.
      * UCI_ShowWDL
type check default false
If enabled, show approximate WDL statistics as part of the engine output. These WDL numbers model expected game outcomes for a given evaluation and game ply for engine self-play at fishtest LTC conditions (60+0.6s per game).
      * UCI_LimitStrength
type check default false
Enable weaker play aiming for an Elo rating as set by UCI_Elo. This option overrides Skill Level.
      * UCI_Elo
type spin default 1320 min 1320 max 3190
If UCI_LimitStrength is enabled, it aims for an engine strength of the given Elo.
This Elo rating has been calibrated at a time control of 120s+1s and anchored to CCRL 40/4.
It takes precedence over Skill Level if both are set.
See also: How do Skill Level and UCI_Elo work
      * Skill Level
type spin default 20 min 0 max 20
Lower the Skill Level in order to make Stockfish play weaker (see also UCI_LimitStrength).
Internally, MultiPV is enabled, and with a certain probability depending on the Skill Level, a weaker move will be played.
See also: How do Skill Level and UCI_Elo work
      * SyzygyPath
type string default <empty>
Path to the folders/directories storing the Syzygy tablebase files. Multiple directories are to be separated by ; on Windows and by : on Unix-based operating systems. Do not use spaces around the ; or :.
Example: C:\tablebases\wdl345;C:\tablebases\wdl6;D:\tablebases\dtz345;D:\tablebases\dtz6
It is recommended to store .rtbw files on an SSD. There is no loss in storing the .rtbz files on a regular HDD. It is recommended to verify all md5 checksums of the downloaded tablebase files (md5sum -c checksum.md5) as corruption will lead to engine crashes.
      * SyzygyProbeDepth
type spin default 1 min 1 max 100
Minimum remaining search depth for which a position is probed. Set this option to a higher value to probe less aggressively if you experience too much slowdown (in terms of nps) due to tablebase probing.
      * Syzygy50MoveRule
type check default true
Disable to let fifty-move rule draws detected by Syzygy tablebase probes count as wins or losses. This is useful for ICCF correspondence games.
      * SyzygyProbeLimit
type spin default 7 min 0 max 7
Limit Syzygy tablebase probing to positions with at most this many pieces left (including kings and pawns).
      * Move Overhead
type spin default 10 min 0 max 5000
Assume a time delay of x ms due to network and GUI overheads. Specifying a value larger than the default is needed to avoid time losses or near instantaneous moves, in particular for time controls without increment (e.g. sudden death). The default is suitable for engine-engine matches played locally on dedicated hardware, while it needs to be increased on a loaded system, when playing over a network, or when using certain GUIs such as Arena or ChessGUI.
      * nodestime
type spin default 0 min 0 max 10000
Tells the engine to use nodes searched instead of wall time to account for elapsed time. Useful for engine testing. When this option is set, the engine is only limited by the total amount of nodes searched per game; this limit is calculated once per game. The initial time control values in milliseconds (time time and increment per move inc) are used as input values to calculate the total number of nodes per game (totalnodes). The increment per move inc is used as if it was just one move per game. The formula is totalnodes = (time + inc * 1) * nodestime. Suppose you specified nodestime = 600, and the time control per game is 300 seconds plus 3 seconds increment per move ("300+3s"), or 300000 milliseconds plus 3000 milliseconds increment per move. In that case, the maximum total number of nodes searched per game by the engine is totalnodes = (300000 + 3000 * 1) * 600 = 181800000 (one hundred eighty-one million, eight hundred thousand) nodes, regardless of how much wall time it will actually take.
      * Debug Log File
type string default
Write all communication to and from the engine into a text file.
position
Usage: position [fen <fenstring> | startpos ] moves <move1> .... <movei>
Set up the position described in fenstring.
If the game was played from the start position the string startpos must be sent.
NOTE
         * If this position is from a different game than the last position sent to the engine, the GUI should have sent a ucinewgame in between.
         * Using moves is the recommended way to set up game positions because the move history allows the engine to correctly handle threefold repetition detection.
Examples:
> position startpos
> position startpos moves e2e4 e7e5 g1f3 b8c6 f1b5
> position fen 8/1B6/8/5p2/8/8/5Qrq/1K1R2bk w - - 0 1
> position fen 8/3P3k/n2K3p/2p3n1/1b4N1/2p1p1P1/8/3B4 w - - 0 1 moves g4f6 h7g7 f6h5 g7g6 d1c2
ucinewgame
This is sent to the engine when the next search (started with position and go) will be from a different game. This can be a new game the engine should play or a new game it should analyze but also the next position from a test suite with positions only.
If the GUI hasn't sent a ucinewgame before the first position command, the engine won't expect any further ucinewgame commands as the GUI is probably not supporting the ucinewgame command.
So the engine will not rely on this command even though all new GUIs should support it.
As the engine's reaction to ucinewgame can take some time the GUI should always send isready after ucinewgame to wait for the engine to finish its operation. The engine will respond with readyok.
NOTE
This clears the hash and any information which was collected during the previous search.
Example
isready
This is used to synchronize the engine with the GUI.
When the GUI has sent a command or multiple commands that can take some time to complete, this command can be used to wait for the engine to be ready again or to ping the engine to find out if it is still alive.
e.g. this should be sent after setting the path to the tablebases as this can take some time.
This command is also required once, before the engine is asked to do any searching, to wait for the engine to finish initializing.
This command will always be answered with readyok and can be sent also when the engine is calculating in which case the engine will also immediately answer with readyok without stopping the search.
Example:
> isready
readyok
go
Start calculating on the current position set up with the position command.
There are a number of parameters that can follow this command and all will be sent in the same string.
Usually at least one parameter is sent to limit the search but it is not required.
NOTE
         * If no parameter is sent, then go depth 245 will be executed.
         * Mixing and matching different ways of limiting the search time (depth, nodes, movetime, wtime + winc + btime + binc) will result in the search ending when it hits any one of those limits. For example, you can limit the search to a maximum depth and time with go depth x movetime y.
Example: go infinite
Example: go depth
Example: go nodes
Example: go mate

Example: MultiPV
Example: UCI_ShowWDL
Parameters:
         * searchmoves <move1> .... <movei>
Restrict search to these moves only.
Example: After position startpos and go infinite searchmoves e2e4 d2d4 the engine will only search the two moves e2e4 and d2d4 in the initial position.
         * ponder
Start searching in pondering mode. It won't exit the search in ponder mode, even if it's mate!
This means that the last move sent in in the position string is the ponder move.
The engine can do what it wants to do, but after a ponderhit command it will execute the suggested move to ponder on.
This means that the ponder move sent by the GUI can be interpreted as a recommendation about which move to ponder.
However, if the engine decides to ponder on a different move, it won't display any mainlines as they are likely to be misinterpreted by the GUI because the GUI expects the engine to ponder on the suggested move.
         * wtime <x>
Tell the engine that White has x ms left on the clock.
         * btime <x>
Tell the engine that Black has x ms left on the clock.
         * winc <x>
Tell the engine that White's increment per move in ms if x > 0.
         * binc <x>
Tell the engine that Black's increment per move in ms if x > 0.
         * movestogo <x>
Tell the engine that there are x moves to the next time control
Note: this will only be sent if x > 0, if you don't get this and get the wtime and btime it's sudden death.
         * depth <x>
Stop the search when depth x has been reached.
         * nodes <x>
Stop the search when approximately x number of nodes have been reached.
         * mate <x>
Stop the search when/if a mate in x or less moves is found.
It will stop if the side to move is mating and since Stockfish 17 when getting mated too.
         * movetime <x>
Stop the search when approximately x ms have passed.
         * infinite
Search until the stop command is given. Stockfish won't exit the search without being told so in this mode!
         * perft <x>
A debugging function to walk the move generation tree of strictly legal moves to count all the leaf nodes of a certain depth.
The bench command can be used to measure the speed of perft.
stop
Stop calculating as soon as possible
Example
ponderhit
The user has played the expected move.
This will be sent if the engine was told to ponder on the same move the user has played.
The engine will continue searching but switch from pondering to normal search.
Example
> setoption name Ponder value true
> position startpos moves e2e4
> go movetime 1000

Non-standard commands
bench
NOTE
            * String parameters are case-sensitive. In case of invalid values of string parameters, the error is not given, and the behavior is undefined (the program does not fall back to a default value).
            * The [file path] may contain one or more positions, each on a separate line.
This runs a standard search benchmark on a pre-selected assortment of positions. It prints the total combined nodes searched, as well as time taken.
This command serves two primary purposes:
            * The total number of nodes searched with default parameters can be used as a "signature" or "fingerprint" of the exact search algorithm version in the binary being used. The main utility of the nodecount signature is to ensure that, when testing possible new patches on Fishtest, the author and workers are working on the exact same code. It also can be used to verify which version or release you have locally although the commit hash is a more direct way to do this.
            * It can be used as a basic nodes-per-second speed benchmark, although we recommend using the speedtest command instead.
Usage: bench [ttSize] [threads] [limit] [fenFile] [limitType]
The standardized nodecount signature of a version is obtained using all default parameters. Each functional commit in the Stockfish commit history includes a standardized nodecount signature. For example, the nodecount signature of Stockfish 15 is 8129754.
Parameter
	Default
	Values
	Meaning
	ttSize
	16
	

	Hash value
	threads
	1
	

	Number of threads
	limit
	13
	

	The limit of limitType
	fenFile
	default
	default, current or [file path]
	The positions used for the bench
	limitType
	depth
	A go parameter (e.g. depth or nodes) or eval
	The type of limit
	Basic example of usage
The bench command may also be used in the command line when executing Stockfish.
./stockfish bench
Running the bench with specific parameters and redirecting the output of the benchmark to a file called "outputFile".
./stockfish bench 16 1 1 inputFile > outputFile
Running the benchmark with specific parameters in the starting position indefinitely and redirecting the output. Note than in this case, the limit is ignored.
./stockfish bench 4096 16 _ current infinite > outputFile
You can use the bench command to measure the speed of perft
speedtest
NOTE
In official releases this command is only available since Stockfish 17.1.
Measures the speed of the computer with a realistic and stable hardware benchmark. By default, Stockfish will run on all available threads, using a reasonable hash, on a number of positions that represent at typical game. The output is the achieved Nodes/second.
The simplest and intended usage is: ./stockfish speedtest
Usage: speedtest [threads] [hash (MiB)] [runtime (s)]
Example with output
Parameter
	Default
	threads
	all
	hash
	threads * 128
	runtime
	150
	d
Display the current position, with ASCII art and FEN.
Example
eval
NOTE
The eval command only provides a very rough evaluation of the position without any search involved and is not recommended for most use cases.
In order to get an accurate evaluation of the current position, you need to use the go command.
Display the static evaluation of the current position.
Example
compiler
Give information about the compiler and environment used for building a binary.
Example:
> compiler


Compiled by g++ (GNUC) 13.1.0 on MinGW64
Compilation settings include:  64bit AVX2 SSE41 SSSE3 SSE2 POPCNT
__VERSION__ macro expands to: 13.1.0
export_net [filenameBigNet] [filenameSmallNet]
Exports the currently loaded network to a file. If the currently loaded network is the embedded network and the filename is not specified then the network is saved to the file matching the name of the embedded network, as defined in evaluate.h. If the currently loaded network is not the embedded network (some net set through the UCI setoption) then the filename parameter is required and the network is saved into that file.
flip
Flips the side to move.
